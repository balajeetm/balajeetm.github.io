author: "Balajee Mohan"
description: "After Monday and Tuesday, even the calendar says 'WTF'. Well, WTF - disappointingly for some, is an acronym of 'What's The Fun?' Yeah, you got it right, we don’t like cliché's, do we? So if you share the same aversion to cliché's, then you came to the right place. Stand out of the crowd. Remove the jargon, take out the abstraction, discard the sugarcoats!<br>Come Let's have fun!<br>Let's unjargon!"

biography: "I am a Software Engineer, based out of Bangalore, India, who is passionate about puzzles and programming. The world around us is so vast, there is so much to explore. But perspective adds so much flavor to reality. I always believe addressing the root case is more important than addressing the symptoms. So it's always good to get down to the roots. Here you can find my <a href='/assets/cv.pdf'>Résumé</a>. Hop in as we explore the fun around us."
