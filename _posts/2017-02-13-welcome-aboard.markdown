Well, WTF - disappointingly for some, is an acronym of <b>"What's The Fun?"</b><br>
Yeah, you got it right, we don’t like cliché's, do we?<br>
So if you share the same aversion to cliché's, then you came to the right place<br>

The world around us is so vast, there is so much to explore.<br>
But perspective adds so much flavor to reality.<br>
The same idea feels and looks so different from different angles.<br>

<div id="perspective">For eg. like the one displayed below</div>

Perspective my friend! Perspective!

But what is right?<br>
Well, is there anything called right at all in this subjective world?<br>
What's right is what makes you feel best and feel light! And of course, is taking you towards your goal...<br>

Let's stop there and not go too far. This isn't a psychology class.<br>
This is a forum where we grind down to the bottom of stuff, and expose the actual.<br>
Rip the mask and show the face!<br>

Well, how far down the rabbit hole do you wannu go though?<br>
Let's be a little cautious there.<br>
Ignorance and misinformation are the greatest epidemics in today's world.<br>
Let's only address that!<br>

When something is complicated, don’t let that discomfort you.<br>
When you don't understand something, don't let that demotivate you.<br>
We will simplify it! Break it down, chew on it and digest it!<br>
Let's face everything head on.<br>

```
Remember, if something cannot be put in a simple way, then it MAY NOT be the right choice!
And, if you cannot explain something in a simple way, then you DO NOT understand it well enough
```

The fun is in the journey, not the destination!<br>
The fun is in how things work and not in its working :)<br>
Yup, not the cliché's.<br>
So if you resonate with the above. Hop on!<br>
<b>It's road to El Dorado!</b><br>

Stand out of the crowd.<br>
Remove the jargon, take out the abstraction, discard the sugarcoats!<br>
<b>Come Let's have fun! Let's unjargon!</b>
