Well, WTF - disappointingly for some, is an acronym of "What's The Fun?"

Yeah, you got it right, we don’t like cliché's, do we?

So if you share the same aversion to cliché's, then you came to the right place


The world around us is so vast, there is so much to explore. 

But perspective adds so much flavor to reality. 

The same idea feels and looks so different from different angles.

For eg. like the one displayed below

Perspective my friend! Perspective!


But what is the right?

Well is there anything called right at all? 

Everything is subjective. What's right is what makes you feel best and feel light!


Let's stop there and not go too far. This isn't a psychology class.

This is a forum where we grind down to the bottom of stuff, and expose the actual.

Rip the mask and show the face!


Well, how far down the rabbit hole do you wannu go?

Let's be a little cautious there.

Ignorance and misinformation is greatest epidemic in today's world.

Let's only address that!


When something is complicated, don’t let that discomfort you.

When you don't understand something, don't let that demotivate you.

We will simplify it! Break it down, chew on it and digest it!

Let's face everything head on.


Remember, if something cannot be put in a simple way, then it MAY NOT be the right choice!

And, if you cannot explain something in a simple way, then you DO NOT understand it well enough


The fun is in the journey, not the destination!

The fun is in how things work and not in its working :)

Yup, not the cliché's.

So if you resonate with the above. Hop on!

<b>It's road to El Dorado!</b>

Stand out of the crowd.<br>
Remove the jargon, take out the abstraction, discard the sugarcoats!<br>
<b>Come Let's have fun! Let's unjargon!</b>
