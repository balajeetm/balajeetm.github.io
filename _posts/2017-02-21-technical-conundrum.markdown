>Silly little B once said that the world is full of problems...<br>
He's absolutely right you know... well... only as long as he isn't complaining.<br>
Problems, are the stepping stones of success... there's nothing wrong about them.<br>
Our attitude towards a problem however, is the point of contention here.<br>

We can either choose to step on it and keep moving forward or meekly back off and fade away.<br>
Well, a word of caution there; running away only increases our distance from the solution. The point of it all was to get to the solution remember?<br>
Ting, Ring - Does that ring a bell?<br>

Alright!!!<br>
Enough of the banter.<br>
Let's man up and face it now shall we? (* discreetly trying not to be sexist)<br>

Problems out there come in various shapes and sizes. In this section, we will deal with only one flavor of those problems. The one that would interest the uncanny [J.A.R.V.I.S](http://ironman.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) kind (* any AI reference here is purely unintentional)<br>

We'll categorize our hurdles as "TecCon".<br>
WTF in TecCon you ask huh?<br>
Well,  TecCon is a shorthand for <b>"Technical Conundrums"</b>. In techy terms..<br>
```
Compress(Technical Conundrums) = TecCon :D (how funny)
```

So ironical isn't it, we keep blabbering about "unjargon" but end up concocting new Jargons.<br>
Well, Stand out of the crowd yo! Be different.<br>
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.<br>
After all, It sounds so jazzy doesn't it?<br>
It gives a nice ring to even our despicable problems.<br>

So TecCon huh? Alright, we "unjars" mutually agree!

In TecCon, we'll try to tackle few programming riddles.<br>
The moto however is not to get to the solution.<br>
Getting a solution is not hard nowadays.<br>
'Oh, just google it yo.'<br>

The cynosure here is the path we take to the solution and more importantly... the detours.<br>
Let's dissect the thought process we carry!<br>
And learn from it.<br>
So cool huh?<br>

Retrospection is the engine of progress. It's what powers it.<br>
So we are not actually fixing the problem, but we are actually fixing our thinking as we move along...<br>
And that, will automatically fix all problems.<br>
<b>#Trust #Faith</b>

Allrighty then, I'm game. Buckle up and board on for the fun ride.<br>
Life after all, is a continuous exercise of creative problem solving.<br>
Hop along, Let's have TecCons for breakfast :)<br>
Ready or not... Here we come!<br>

>insert awesome quote here

```
'Problems are like washing machines, they twist us, spin us and knock us around,
but in the end we come out cleaner, brighter and better than before'
```

Duh!!! So cheesy!<br>
Give me a break!
