>Silly little B once said that the world is full of problems...<br>
He's absolutely right you know... well... only as long as he isn't complaining.<br>
Problems, are the stepping stones of success... there's nothing wrong about them.<br>
Our attitude towards a problem however, is the point of contention here.<br>

We can either choose to step on it and keep moving forward, or, meekly back off, and fade away.<br>
Well, a word of caution there; running away only increases our distance from the solution. The point of it all was to get to the goal remember?<br>
Ting, Ring - Does that ring a bell?<br>

Alright!!!<br>
Enough of the banter.<br>
Let's man up and face it now shall we? (* discreetly trying not to be sexist)<br>

Problems out there, come in various shapes and sizes. In this section, we will deal with only one flavor of those problems. The one that would interest the uncanny [J.A.R.V.I.S](http://ironman.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) kind (* any AI reference here is purely unintentional)<br>

We'll categorize our hurdles as "T-Nut"s.<br>
[WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in a T-Nut you ask huh?<br>
Well, T-Nut is a technical nut, we are trying to crack. An alias for <b>"Technical Conundrums"</b>. In techy terms..<br>
```
Compress(Technical Nut) = T-Nut :D (how funny)
```

T-Nut in short, is any problem statement, that excites us and that we are willing to crack.<br>
The irony is strong in this one though, isn't it? We keep blabbering about "unjargon" but end up concocting new [Jargons](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jargon) like "T-Nut"<br>
[WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in that?

Well, Stand out of the crowd yo! Be different.<br>
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.<br>
After all, "T-Nut" does sound jazzy doesn't it? It also gives a nice ring to our despicable problems.<br>

Jokes apart, T-Nut is more than just a catchy phrase.
In T-Nut, we'll try to tackle many riddles.<br>
The moto however is not to just get to the solution.<br>
Getting a solution is not hard nowadays. 'Oh, just google it yo.'<br>

The cynosure here is the path we take to the solution and, not to forget, the detours.<br>
Let's dissect the thought process we carry, and iteratively learn from it.<br>
[WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in learning you ask, huh?<br>
We don't want to make the same mistakes again, do we? There are so many new ones to make. :D<br>

Honestly, T-Nut is like the seed that resides in the centre of a fruit.<br>
Small in size but herculean in stature.<br>
The seed can open doors to new avenues, can beget and nourish enormous trees of knowledge, rooted strongly in new paradigms.<br>
But just like in a fruit, the T-Nut as a seed, is shrouded in edible [pericarps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Pericarp_layers) and non-edible [epicarps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Epicarp).<br>

Getting to the core and getting to the seed is a journey... A journey to cherish.<br>
As we march towards the T-Nut, we need to cull the epicarp, swallow the pericarp, and before we realize, we would have reached the epicenter as a completely different being.<br>

```
Like they say, everyone wants a magical solution to their problem,
but they refuse to believe in magic. 
The magic is in the seed.
Let's sow and reap the right ones.
```

So the focus of our stints in T-Nut, is more on the journey, than the destination.<br>
We are not actually fixing the problem, but **we are more fixing our thinking as we move along**, with a stern belief, that that by itself, will automatically eradicate all problems. If not, it will at least make us more competent to tussle with them.<br>
<b>#Trust #Faith</b>

So cool huh?<br>
Allrighty then, I'm game. Buckle up and board on for the fun ride.<br>
Life after all, is a continuous exercise of creative problem solving.<br>
Hop along, Let's have T-Nuts for breakfast :)<br>
Ready or not... Here we come!<br>

>insert awesome quote here

```
'Problems are like washing machines,
they twist us, spin us and knock us around,
but in the end we come out cleaner, brighter and better than before'
```

Duh!!! So cheesy!<br>
Give me a break!
