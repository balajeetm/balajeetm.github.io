>In my earlier post, we saw what a [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) is. We also said, moving along, we are gonna be cracking a lot of those.<br>
But how does one go about it? What follows, is a step by step guideline, to cracking a T-Nut.<br>

## The Thought Train
<hr>

Any problem solving is like cracking a nut. So, we are gonna use the analogy of literally chewing on an unknown fruit and careen our way to the seed/t-nut at the centre.<br>
Remember, just like in a fruit, the T-Nut as a seed, is shrouded in edible [pericarps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Pericarp_layers) and non-edible [epicarps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Epicarp).<br>
As we march towards the [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/), we need to cull the epicarp and swallow the pericarp.<br>

Let's begin then<br>

## Step 1 - Isolate the [epicarp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Epicarp)
<hr>

### Why isolate ?
This is an unknown fruit. Before we begin cracking the nut in it, let's make sure we understand or atleast roughly gauge the nut.<br>
Is it a groundnut, peanut or a walnut?<br>
And what about the fruit concealing it?<br>
What's its size, texture, and so on…<br>

Basically, ask yourself, if you truly understand the problem.<br>
Once we know the kind of fruit and get to the nut, cracking it is just one hammer away.<br>
Now, why don't we understand the problem?<br>
What's stopping us? Its our distance from the problem, distance from the [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/), that's making it harder, isn't it?<br>
Let's take a closer look.<br>
To do that, let's first set aside the epicarp veiling the fruit.<br>

### What's an [epicarp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Epicarp) ?
The epicarp typically, is a seemingly useless, unrelated information, masking the problem.<br>
As you wander into the real world, be it in your corporate environment, or your personal life, rarely is someone going to hand us the problem - like, [reverse a linked list](/blog/2017/02/26/tnut-reverse-linked-list-pocket/).<br>
Almost Never.<br>
It is up to us to identify the problem, which is more often than not, in hiding.<br>

### What does isolating mean ?
**Isolating the epicarp is the process of isolating and understanding the problem statement we are trying to address**<br>
Sometimes, just isolating the epicarp, can almost get you to the solution.<br>

### An typical example

Still doesn't ring a bell?<br>
Try this [example](/blog/2017/03/10/isolate-epicaro-example) and get back.<br>

### Synopsis

Putting things together, <b>The <u>typical approach</u> to cull the epicarp would be as below</b><br>
* <b>Simplify the problem statement</b><br> 
Jot down the naïve problem statement that you can atleast vaguely comprehend
* <b>Extract the buzz words</b><br>
Pull out all the jargons and buzz words that hit on you and try to connect them together

## Step 2 - Take the first bite
<hr>

### Where do we begin ?
It's not often that culling the epicarp will give us the solution. It does better the visibility of the fruit and nut though... But [it aint over till the fat lady sings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_ain't_over_till_the_fat_lady_sings).<br>
So what do we do next? We don't know the nature of the fruit yet. How do we take a bite?<br>

Well, 'Hunger' knows no barriers. Let's bite our way through.<br>

Our first bites are always calculative right. We prefer to bite the juicy side, at least what we think is juicy.<br>

### What's so juicy?
Juicy here is a problem area which we know to address with ease. Something that we are comfortable with...<br>
Something the looks tasty...<br>
So for the next bite, we will look at the fruit from an angle where it seems palatable and then take that out. Make the problem more colorful and exciting<br>

### What's taking the bite ?
So taking the first bite is the process of looking at the problem statement through the lens of something that we already know.<br>
Basically, try to convert it to something that you have got around of sometime before.<br>
Apart from the invaluable psychological edge that it boosts, it gives you a path to start walking towards a goal.<br>

### Synopsis
<b>The <u>typical approach</u> of taking the first bite would be</b><br>
* <b>Visual Representation</b><br>
Make it more colorful and exiciting.<br>
Create a visual representation of the problem.
* <b>Relatable Examples</b><br>
Ensure to take relatable examples. If you have never seen such a problem, try to draw parallels with the real world.<br>
If you have seen similar problems, try to keep it as close to your earlier problem as possible.
* <b>Analyze Input Output Samples</b><br>
Begin by analysing the input and output samples and see if we can catch some rhythm. Catch some logic.<br>
Try to see if you can guess the output, seeing the input. That's where we would want to start.
* <b>Solve it mentally</b><br> 
Let your "pristine brain" solve it. Go with the flow and mentally solve it.<br>
We can later convert it into logic for the "computational brain"

## Step 3 - Swallow the initial bite
<hr>

Next, start to chew on what you bit.<br>
When we chew on a tasty fruit, we generally focus on the aspects of the fruit that we like.<br>
Its sweetness, juice, color, etc<br>
On similar lines, focus on the aspects of the problem, that you can take away.<br>
Let the bite flow through your esophagus and smoothly into the bowels.<br>
Let some logic to flow through the disparate dots and help connect them.<br>

Swallowing is thus synonymous to analysis, logic gathering and retrospection.<br>
You can do this mentally, scribble on paper or start hacking some code.<br>
Do a lot of retrospection and see if the dots connect and check if you are going the right direction.<br>
Try not to force a solution, let it be smooth<br>
The way we swallow greatly influences the next bites we would take. Try to not make it hard for ourselves to take subsequent bites<br>

* Identify the edge cases if any through the input output samples
* Begin with naïve "pristine brain" approach and see if you can convert that to a programming logic
* More often, you will be unable to do that, since the "pristine brain" works very differently than the "logical brain".<br>
Just because you solved something mentally, doesn't always mean you can write a program for it. We get stuck most of times when we try to pen something down for this reason. This is why interviewers insist us to write code. This is not to test your syntax strength but to identify some pitfalls in your reasoning.

#### Note

But our pristine brain is extremely adaptable. The more of such problems we solve, the more efficient it will become in working with these types of constraints. And for this reason, we will be cracking a lot of such [T-Nuts](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/).
	
While, the logical brain always looks for constraints, the pristine brain always ignores it, if it isn't explicit. "Pristine Brain" only cares about getting to the goal, however that is. So it is important we present the problem with all constraints emphasized, through the "Logical Counterpart"
	

## Step 4 - Take more bites
<hr>

Alright, we've kind of got the flavour of fruit as we chewed it.<br>
If you liked what you bit, take similar bites and stride towards the goal.<br>
If you didn't like the taste of the bite, pick the next juicy spot.<br>
Sometimes, our initial approaches may not be the right one.<br>
What we thought was the juicy side, may not turn out to be so.<br>
Change the approach and look for another juicy side until we find the sweet spot.<br>
We may need to change our visual representation to suit the newer approach... So be it.<br>

This is the crux of problem solving.<br>
Never [hold on] to a solution. We should be able to learn from our approach and [let it go] when situation demands. Don't hold on too tight onto anything<br>

Believe in law of conservation of thought
```
"You thinking and effort cannot be destroyed.
It will manifest itself some way or the other and turn out fruitful"
```

## Step 5 - Swallow the next bite
<hr>

As you move along, you can either choose to take similar bites and narrow down on the solution or take a divergent path.<br>
Each time, try to get some logic flow through and digest the approach.<br>
Retrospect and ask yourself if this is taking you towards the goal. Feedback is extremely important<br>
	
## Step 6 - Optimize the final bites
<hr>

As you keep gnawing you way through, you are nibbling away the fruit that you have got to work with.<br>
On one hand, you are getting closer to the nut and have probably even discerned the weak links. Once you get to the nut, all it needs is that one shot and the nut will crack open.<br>

On the other hand, we need to now focus on the areas we ignored. The functional core might be in place (or it may seem so), now it is time for the litmus test.<br>
Try out the edge cases, empty input and invalid input scenarios and ensure all of these are handled gracefully.<br>
Our logic shouldn't go bonkers!!!<br>
Sometimes, the edge cases can highlight a major flaw in our logic and guess what, we may need to start all over again.<br>
Empty your tummy, pick up a new fruit and start gnawing your way through<br>

## Step 7 - Beware of pit falls
<hr>

Last but not least, the pit falls!
Many a times, the way we chose to approach the problem, might take us off course and lead to a lot a problems.<br>
And only deep down the thought process, we may realise we are going astray.<br>
But, we would have worked on it so much, that we would be in denial to accept that this approach is not the right one. So we may still go ahead and tweak the solution and see if it fits.<br>
Well, remember what I said before? Don't hold on too tight, [let go]()<br>
Choose an alternative path and move on. Believe in law of conservation of thought.

The above approach including pitfalls is demonstarted in the example [here](). Do have a look.<br>
Its' road to El Dorado then!!
