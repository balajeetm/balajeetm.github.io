>In my earlier post, we saw what a [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) is and how we go about [cracking a T-Nut](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut).<br>
We also used our [allegorical guideline](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut) to crack a typical Little B [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) of [reversing a linked list](/blog/2017/02/26/tnut-reverse-linked-list-pocket/).<br>
Let's see if we can simplify our elaborate guide.

## Cracking the T-Nut
<hr>

As per our analogy of chewing on an unknown fruit, the steps to crack a [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) would be as below :

<img src="/assets/2017-03-09/steps.png">

### [Step1 - Cull the epicarp](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-1---cull-the-epicarp)
<hr>

* <b>Simplify the problem statement</b><br> 
Jot down the naïve problem statement that you can atleast vaguely comprehend
* <b>Extract the buzz words</b><br>
Pull out all the jargons and buzz words that hit on you and try to connect them together

### [Step2 - Take the first bite](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-2---take-the-first-bite)
<hr>

* <b>Visual Representation</b><br>
Make it more colorful, vivid and exciting.<br>
Create a visual representation of the problem.
* <b>Relatable Examples</b><br>
Ensure to take relatable examples. If we have never seen such a problem, let's try to draw parallels with the real world.<br>
If we have seen similar problems, let's try to keep it as close to our earlier problem as possible.
* <b>Analyze the Input Output Samples</b><br>
Begin by analysing the input and output samples and see if we can catch some rhythm. Catch some logic.<br>
Try to see if we can guess the output, seeing the input. That's where we would want to start.
* <b>Solve it mentally</b><br> 
Let our ["pristine brain"](/blog/2017/03/18/pristine-logical-brain/#who-is-who) take centre stage. Go with the flow and mentally solve it.<br>
We can work the logic around it later.

### [Step3 - Chew and swallow the bite](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-3---chew-and-swallow-the-bite)
<hr>

* <b>Identify the edge cases</b><br>
Re look at the samples and try to identify some anomalies or edge cases, apparent in the samples provided.
* <b>Create a logical flow</b><br>
Begin with naïve ["pristine brain"](/blog/2017/03/18/pristine-logical-brain/#who-is-who) approach and see if you can convert that to a programmable logic or a logical diagram. Make tweaks in the thinking if need be.
* <b>Retrospect</b><br>
Let's keep asking ourselves if we are going towards the goal with our current approach.<br>
Moving fast is useless, if we are moving in the wrong direction.<br>
If the approach seems complicated, let's give it some rest and try something else.

### [Step 4 - Take more bites](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-4---take-more-bites)
<hr>

* Adapt to Change. Take new bites. Try out a new strategy or optimize the current one.
* [Law of conservation of thought](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#law-of-conservation-of-thought)

### [Step 5 - Swallow the next bite](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-5---swallow-the-next-bite)
<hr>

A repeat of Step-3
* Sculpt out a sustainable, workable logic.
* Retrospect and evaluate the approach and check if it is taking us towards the goal.
* Bite -> Swallow -> Retrospect

### [Step 6 - Optimize the final bites](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-6---optimize-the-final-bites)
<hr>

* Identify and work on the constraints
* Litmus test the solution with various edge cases
* Address the NFRs. Evaluate [Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) and [Space Complexities](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)

### [Step 7 - Perpetual Optimization](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-7---perpetual-optimization)
<hr>

* Let go and feel comfortable to start all over again.
* Necessity is the mother of invention. Do what is needed.
* Don't over engineer. Keep it simple.

## Simplified Nut Cracker
<hr>

If we find ourselves in no man's land, cracking a obscure [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/), with no idea as to how to strike blows, following each of the above steps religiously makes complete sense. It would pave a path for us to move forward.<br>
If you observe, Step 4 and Step 5 are separated from steps 2 & 3, only to enforce the idea of retrospection and feedback in our next logic cycle.<br>
Once this idea is clear, we can observe that the first bite we take, is no different from any other bites.<br>
The process thus, would be simplified as below:
### <u>Culling Epicarp</u>
Would be a process of isolating the problem statement from the other verbal gibberish.
### <u>Biting</u>
Would be a process of aligning to a known visual representation and devising a strategy to crack the nut.
### <u>Chewing & Swallowing</u>
Would be creating the logical manifestation of our strategy and critically evaluating it within the given constraints.
### <u>Final Bites</u>
Would involve addressing the edge cases and NFRs
### <u>Perpetual Optimization</u>
All of the above would go through a perpetual cycle of optimization

Diagrammatically, this simplified guideline can be represented as below;
