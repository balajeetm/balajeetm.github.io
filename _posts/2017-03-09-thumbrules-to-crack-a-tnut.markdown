>In my earlier post, we saw what a [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) is and how we go about [cracking a T-Nut](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut)<br>
Below is the short step by step guide on how we crack it.

## Step 1 - Isolate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Epicarp">epicarp</a>
<hr>

* <b>Simplify the problem statement</b><br> 
Jot down the naïve problem statement that you can atleast vaguely comprehend
* <b>Extract the buzz words</b><br>
Pull out all the jargons and buzz words that hit on you and try to connect them together

## Step 2 - Take the first bite
<hr>

* <b>Visual Representation</b><br>
Make it more colorful, vivid and exciting.<br>
Create a visual representation of the problem.
* <b>Relatable Examples</b><br>
Ensure to take relatable examples. If you have never seen such a problem, try to draw parallels with the real world.<br>
If you have seen similar problems, try to keep it as close to your earlier problem as possible.
* <b>Analyze the Input Output Samples</b><br>
Begin by analysing the input and output samples and see if you can catch some rhythm. Catch some logic.<br>
Try to see if you can guess the output, seeing the input. That's where we would want to start.
* <b>Solve it mentally</b><br> 
Let your "pristine brain" centre stage. Go with the flow and mentally solve it.<br>
We can work the logic around it later.

## Step 3 - Chew the bite and swallow
<hr>

* <b>Identify the edge cases</b><br>
Re look at the samples and try to identify some anomalies or edge cases, apparent in the samples provided.
* <b>Program some logic</b><br>
Begin with naïve "pristine brain" approach and see if you can convert that to a programming logic. Make tweaks in the thinking if need be.
* <b>Retrospect</b><br>
Keep asking yourself if you are going towards the goal with your current approach.<br>
Moving fast is useless, if you are moving in the wrong direction.<br>
If the approach seems complicated, give it some rest and try something else.

## Step 4 - Take more bites
<hr>

* Adapt to Change. Take new bites
* Law of conservation of thought

## Step 5 - Swallow the next bite
<hr>

* Repeat Step-3

## Step 6 - Optimize the final bites
<hr>

* Work with constraints
* Litmus test it various edge cases

## Step 7 - Beware of pit falls
<hr>

* Beware of the pitfalls
* Let go and feel comfortable to start all over again
