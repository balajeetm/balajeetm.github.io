>Software engineering process has become synonymous to using Agile methodologies in the contemporary era.<br>
Almost every enterprise is using it nowadays.<br>
But [WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in Agile?<br>


**Why Agile?**<br>

Software engineering is a stream of engineering. Is there any other engineering stream, in which, such philosophies are followed?<br>
Mechanical and Civil Engineering for eg are way matured in their process flow, which btw, has evolved over time.
How does Agile find its place in this ocean of options?<br>

## The Perils of Engineering Streams
<hr>

Software Engineering is unlike any other stream of engineering.<br>
It's different from Civil Engineering, where we erect enormous structures (skyscrapers, bridges, dams, etc),
or Mechanical Engineering, where we build products and machineries (cars, turbines, etc.)<br>

_**How is it different, you ask aye?**_

### <u>Stages of Product Engineering</u>

The typical stages of product engineering is as below

```
Plan -> Build -> Maintain
```

Let's look at the cost of these stages as a function of time.<br>
For eg, let's look at the stages for constructing a skyscraper.<br>

<img src="/assets/2017-03-14/cost.png">

The cost, during planning is negligible, because, there are very few people doing it and also, we do not procure any material as such.<br>
It increases substantially once we begin building it, owing to labour, material and other procurement costs.<br>
The cost of maintenance is much lesser compared to the cost of building of course.<br>

Another thing that stands out in the diagram, is that, a lot of time is spent in Planning.<br>
**But why so?**

To answer that, let's try to understand, at what time does the product actually deliver some value.<br>
We'll update the diagram to reflect the value of product over time.<br>

<img src="/assets/2017-03-14/value.png">

### <u>The Risk</u>

So we see, the skyscraper is only valuable, when it's completed and ready for the world to use.<br>
So what until then?<br>
All the investment of time and effort is a risk.<br>

**Which is why a lot of time is spent in planning, just to ensure these risks are mitigated.**<br>

<img src="/assets/2017-03-14/risk.png">

Remember... these risks are extremely expensive…<br>
Because, the cost of change during the later part of the build or maintenance stage, is humungous.<br>
This includes cost in time, as well as money.<br>
You cannot remove a floor after its built, can you?<br>
There is very little flexibility for change in the later stages of the lifecycle.<br>

This is why a lot of time is spent in planning, to ensure that, all edge cases are covered and risks are captured.<br>
Subsequently, these risks are analyzed and a strategy is hatched, to prevent or overcome these risks.<br>
Now that takes time… a lot of time.<br>
Lots and lots of time.<br>

## The Uniqueness of Software Engineering
<hr>

Software products thankfully are unlike any sky scrappers.<br>
That's obvious, because they go beyond these towers, and reach the cloud !!!<br>

Jokes apart, software has two distinctive USPs
* Low Cost to Change
* Low Cost to Distribute

### <u>Feedback from Users</u>

Because software has very **"Low cost of distribution"**, we can share it with the world very quickly.<br>

Remember, how easy it is for us to install a new app on the phone or a new software on our laptops.<br>
And with tons of new ones coming out each day, its just exciting for many "app-buffs" to try them all out.<br>

The users of our software, thus use them and provide us with invaluable feedback.<br>
This feedback helps us identify the risks in our design early.<br>
We can have this feedback drive our innovation by incorporating the learnings into our design.<br>

Now, because software also has **"Low cost to change"**, we can implement the learnings rapidly.<br>
We can break the learnings into smaller usable features and work on them in an iterative fashion.<br>
And, continuously distribute it to our users, who can use them and revert with feedbacks.<br>
Once again, we can fuel this feedback into our iterative development.<br>

Now we enter the age of Rapid Iterative Development with continuous feedback.<br>
We enter the **"Age of Agile Development"** with continuous improvement<br>

<img src="/assets/2017-03-14/agile.png">

So, we quickly transform from fixed to flexible <br>
<img src="/assets/2017-03-14/streams.png">

So we are able to deliver value incrementally unlike in any other engineering stream.<br>
This not just lowers risk, for we also have umpteen opportunities to course correct.<br>

## Agile for Dummies
<hr>

So, now that we know we are doing Agile, let's try to define Agile Development to a lay man.<br>
If you are expecting some factual, text book definition... I'm extremely sorry to disappoint you, I'm not going to give you that.<br>

### <u>What's in a logo?</u>

[Deutsche Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank), has a very interesting logo which looks like below:
<img src="/assets/2017-03-14/deutsche-bank.png">

_**What's in this logo, you ask aye?**_<br>

Looks simple and sweet,<br>
A square and an unconnected diagonal... so what?<br>
[WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in it?<br>

When the CEO was asked what the logo meant, this is what he explained.<br>
>The square represents constraints...<br>
The diagonal represents, growth...<br>
[Deutsche Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank), is growth within constraints.

Take a bow!!!<br>
Great explanation... Well, that's exactly what **Agile** is...<br>
But how do you grow in a constrained environment?<br>
The answer is **FEEDBACK !!!**

_**Aye!!! Way to go! Spot on!**_<br>
So, Agile development is

```
Growth within constraints with constant feedback
```

## Agile as the way of life
<hr>

If you have mistaken, **Agile** is not just about software.<br>
**Agile** is the way of life.<br>

The real world is full of mysteries. As we step into it, we can never guess what's round the bend.<br>
Often, we reach crossroads, where we are cornered to make a choice.<br>
_**But, when one doesn't even know the destination, how does one make the choice?**_<br>

**Go Agile Folks… Wherever possible.**

* Choose a path from the options available, based on cognitive reasoning
* Honestly accept the fact, that the path you choose, on hind sight, may not turn out to be the best choice, further down the line
* Remember the [Law of Conversation of Thought](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#law-of-conservation-of-thought), - Learn from the journey and take smarter strides
* Completely accept the fact that even this stride, might not be most prudent one, on hind sight 
* Take smaller strides and more feedbacks
* Let go and move on... Learn from everything and everyone

I found a [brilliant video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdw_9dADM-4), summarizing the above. Do have a look.<br>
Cya until next time folks.
