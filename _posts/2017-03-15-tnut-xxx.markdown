> It was a gloomy evening and we were sipping some hot tea, peeking through the transparent window.<br>
The day was so dull that even the sun didn't want to show up all day.<br>
He hid behind the clouds, robbing us off our spirits.<br>
The lacklustre day couldn't get any more sluggish... we were craving for some entertainment.<br>
So Little B decided to bombard us with one of his [T-Nuts](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) to cheer us up.<br>
As trivial a problem that it seemed to be, nothing is ever so simple with Little B, is it?

## Hone your math skills

Little B started stating the problem.<br>

<img src="/assets/2017-03-15/xxx.png">

>
"You are at the door of enlightenment.<br>
Behind the door lies new realms of reality.<br>
A world of peace, freedom and endless knowledge.<br>
A world without constraints, concerns or constructs.<br>
A world with no beginning and end.<br>
An enticing utopia, freeing you from your chains.<br><br>
You are just a step away from it.<br>
A locked door standing between you and the paradise.<br>
The door has a huge **'XXX'** embossed on it.<br> 
The key to the door is the solution to a cryptic puzzle.", he continued.<br><br>
"Beside the door, are two crates.<br>
The first crate, is full of spherical magic balls, etched with numbers.<br>
While the second crate is empty.<br>
The magic balls are all of the same diameter and shape.<br>
The balls can freely move inside the crate.<br>
They are perfectly smooth and glittering.<br>
They vary in color and have different numbers etched on them as shown below.<br>
Each ball has an unique number etched on it.<br>
No two balls are engraved with the same number.<br>

### <u>The Problem Statement</u><br>

The cryptic puzzle he stated was as below:

_**"You need to pick, three balls from the first crate, no more, no less and place them in the second crate.<br>
The constraint being, the sum of the carvings on the balls should add to thirty,<br>
XXX in roman, and thus the vignette on the door!<br>
Three balls, No more, No less.<br>
Summing to 30 (XXX)"**_<br>

## The Thought Train
<hr>

Let's begin [cracking the T-Nut](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/), like we always do.<br>
As if chewing on an unknown fruit following this [guide](/blog/2017/03/09/thumbrules-to-crack-a-tnut).<br>
VROOM VROOM!

## [Step1 - Isolate the epicarp](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-1---isolate-the-epicarp)
<hr>

I'm sure there was too much gibberish in that, so let me fish the actual problem statement.<br>

* <b><u>The Na√Øve Problem Statement</u></b><br>
It's a simple math quiz.

```
Find x,y,z where
x + y + z = 30

```

## [Step2 - Take the first bite](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-2---take-the-first-bite)
<hr>

Visual representation is already provided. Let me think out loud to solve it.<br>
Alright, 3 variables. I would need 3 equations at least.<br>
Let me see if can find the other two.

I find an inequation
```
x,y,z <=15
```

And they are all odd,
```
Any odd number can be represented as 2k+1, so
x = 2a + 1,
y = 2b + 1,
z = 2c + 1
```

It's not much use to create more variables.<br>
Hey, wait a second. That's an anomaly.<br>

***Sum of three old numbers cannot be even!***

## [Step3 - Chew and swallow the bite](http://blog.balajeetm.com/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-3---chew-and-swallow-the-bite)
<hr>

Yup, surely. Sum of three odd cannot be even. Here's the proof for non-believers.

```
x + y + z = 30
(2a + 1) + (2b + 1) + (2c + 1) = 30
2(a + b + c) + 3 = 30
2 (a + b + c + 1) + 1 = 30
 
if p = (a + b + c + 1),

2p + 1 = 30.
```

Cannot be!!!<br>
**Odd cannot be equal to even<br>
So, NO SOLUTION**

## The Mockery
<hr>

As we were basking in the glory of cracking the [t-nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/), all Little B could manage was a satirical grin.<br>
Infuriated by his disdainful visage, we enquired as to what was so funny to smile?<br>
We asked him,<br>
_"Is accepting that we could crack your [T-Nut] with such ease, such a bitter pill to swallow?"_

He stood up starting walking away, pausing momentarily before fading into the twilight.<br>
Looking away from us and without even turning towards our side, he mocked,
>"You stand at the doors of heaven, with a free ticket to freedom.<br>
All you need to do is choose three freaking balls that'll redefine your life for ever.<br>
And what do end up doing?<br>
Laugh at the door, taunting the question is wrong.<br>
And you even have the audacity to rejoice the moment?<br>
The trouble with us all if we don't even to define victory.<br>
We don't even understand our battles, letgo choosing them.<br>
Bravo Guys!!! Have fun!!"

More than the way he scorned at the us, the depth of his ridicule and the utter hopeless of our approach highlighted in his derision broke us apart.<br>
So true, I'm a step away from paradise.<br>
And a freaking elementary math problem is blocking me?<br>
No way, time to go full throttle.<br>

We jumped at the problem again with renewed resolve.

## [Step 4 - Take more bites](http://blog.balajeetm.com/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-4---take-more-bites) and [Step 5 - Swallow the next bite](http://blog.balajeetm.com/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-5---swallow-the-next-bite)
<hr>

However I look at it, the sum of three odd numbers cannot turn even.<br>
There is nothing more in the problem to extract as well. The crate with balls is there for full view.<br>
After a sleepless night of futile effort, we ran to Little B to understand the solution.<br>

## The Solution

Little B smiled at our inanity and picked three balls as below to show the solution.

<img src="/assets/2017-03-15/solution.png">

As we looked at it, the whole world came crashing at us.<br>
"Come on!!! How the heck did I miss that?", I said to myself.<br>
It was impossible to digest my folly... my idiocy.<br>
Huh!!! Unbearable!!!<br>

Where did I lose track, I wondered and re-read the key aspect in the question that I had missed.<br>
_**"The balls can freely move inside the crate"**_

With hands in his pocket, Little B stood up sluggishly, and started walking away, muttering,<br>
_**"All you need to do is let go and look at the problem from a different angle"**_, he said, walking off, not bothering to even look by our side as he faded into the distance.<br>
