> It was a gloomy evening and we were sipping some hot tea, peeking through the transparent window.<br>
The day was so dull that even the sun didn't want to show up all day.<br>
He hid behind the clouds, robbing us off our spirits.<br>
The lacklustre day couldn't get any more sluggish... we were craving for some entertainment.<br>
So Little B decided to bombard us with one of his [T-Nuts](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) to cheer us up.<br>
As trivial a problem that it seemed to be, nothing is ever so simple with Little B, is it?

## Hone your math skills

Little B started stating the problem.<br>

>
"You are at the door of enlightenment.<br>
Behind the door lies new realms of reality.<br>
A world of peace, freedom and endless knowledge.<br>
A world without constraints, concerns or constructs.<br>
A world with no beginning and end.<br>
An enticing utopia, freeing you from your chains.<br><br>
You are just a step away from it.<br>
A locked door standing between you and the paradise.<br>
The door has a huge **'XXX'** embossed on it.<br> 
The key to the door is the solution to a cryptic puzzle.", he continued.<br><br>
"Beside the door, are two crates.<br>
The first crate, is full of spherical magic balls, etched with numbers.<br>
While the second crate is empty.<br>
The magic balls are all of the same diameter and shape.<br>
The balls can freely move inside the crate.<br>
They are perfectly smooth and glittering.<br>
They vary in color and have different numbers etched on them as shown below.<br>
Each ball has an unique number etched on it.<br>
No two balls are engraved with the same number.<br>

### <u>The Problem Statement</u><br>

The cryptic puzzle he stated was as below:

_**"You need to pick, three balls from the first crate, no more, no less and place them in the second crate.<br>
The constraint being, the sum of the carvings on the balls should add to thirty,<br>
XXX in roman, and thus the vignette on the door!<br>
Three balls, No more, No less.<br>
Summing to 30 (XXX)"**_<br>

## The Thought Train
<hr>

Let's begin [cracking the T-Nut](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/), like we always do.<br>
As if chewing on an unknown fruit following this [guide](/blog/2017/03/09/thumbrules-to-crack-a-tnut).<br>
VROOM VROOM!

## [Step1 - Isolate the epicarp](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-1---isolate-the-epicarp)
<hr>

I'm sure there was too much gibberish in that, so let me fish the actual problem statement.<br>

* <b><u>The Na√Øve Problem Statement</u></b><br>
It's a simple math quiz.

```
Find x,y,z where
x + y + z = 30

```

## [Step2 - Take the first bite](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-2---take-the-first-bite)
<hr>

Visual representation is already provided. Let me think out loud to solve it.<br>
Alright, 3 variables. I would need 3 equations at least.<br>
Let me see if can find the other two.

I find an inequation
```
x,y,z <=15
```

And they are all odd,
```
Any odd number can be represented as 2k+1, so
x = 2a + 1,
y = 2b + 1,
z = 2c + 1
```

It's not much use to create more variables.<br>
Hey, wait a second. That's an anomaly.<br>

***Sum of three old numbers cannot be even!***

## [Step3 - Chew and swallow the bite](http://blog.balajeetm.com/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/#step-3---chew-and-swallow-the-bite)
<hr>

Yup, surely. Sum of three odd cannot be even. Here's the proof for non-believers.

```
x + y + z = 30
(2a + 1) + (2b + 1) + (2c + 1) = 30
2(a + b + c) + 3 = 30
2 (a + b + c + 1) + 1 = 30
 
if p = (a + b + c + 1),

2p + 1 = 30.

Cannot be!!!
