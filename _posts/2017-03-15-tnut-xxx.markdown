> It was a gloomy evening and we were sipping some hot tea, peeking through the transparent window.<br>
The day was so dull that even the sun didn't want to show up all day.<br>
He hid behind the clouds, robbing us off our spirits.<br>
The lacklustre day couldn't get any more sluggish... we were craving for some entertainment.<br>
So Little B decided to bombard us with one of his T-Nuts to cheer us up.<br>
As trivial a problem that it seemed to be, nothing is ever so simple with Little B, is it?

** Hone your math skills

Little B started stating the problem.<br>

_"You are at the door of enlightenment.<br>
Behind the door lies new realms of reality.<br>
A world of peace, freedom and endless knowledge.<br>
A world without constraints, concerns or constructs.<br>
A world with no beginning and end.<br>
An enticing utopia, freeing you from your chains.<br><br>
You are just a step away from it.<br>
A locked door standing between you and the paradise.<br>
The door has a huge **'XXX'** embossed on it.<br> 
The key to the door is the solution to a cryptic puzzle.", he continued.<br><br>
"Beside the door, are two crates.<br>
The first crate, is full of spherical magic balls, etched with numbers.<br>
While the second crate is empty.<br>
The magic balls are all of the same diameter and shape.<br>
The balls can freely move inside the crate.<br>
They are perfectly smooth and glittering.<br>
They vary in color and have different numbers etched on them as shown below.<br>
Each ball has an unique number etched on it.<br>
No two balls are engraved with the same number.<br>

*** <u>The Problem Statement</u><br>

The cryptic puzzle he stated was as below:

_**"You need to pick, three balls from the first crate, no more, no less and place them in the second crate.<br>
The constraint being, the sum of the carvings on the balls should add to thirty,<br>
XXX in roman, and thus the vignette on the door!<br>
Three balls, No more, No less.<br>
Summing to 30 (XXX)"**_<br>
