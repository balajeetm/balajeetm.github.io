> In my previous [post](/blog/2017/03/15/tnut-xxx/), we looked at a typical Little B [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/).<br>
If you didn't manage to [crack it](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/), well don't fret.<br>
Just for the stats,
**According to psychology, if a normal person had not seen that problem before, the person shouldn't have been able to crack it.**<br>
Wow! That's a blatant claim. [WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in that? Why am I saying so?

## Tricky Nut
<hr>

Let' see for ourselves. Why was the [T-Nut](/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/) so hard to crack?<br>
It sure wasn't an undoable math problem, was it?<br>

>[It's elementary arithmetic, my dear Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#.22Elementary.2C_my_dear_Watson.22)

What was it then?<br>
_**We didn't manage to look at the problem from a [different angle](/blog/2017/03/15/tnut-xxx/#differentangle)**_<br>

Duh!!!<br>
That's so easy to say, after we know the solution.<br>
[WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in not getting the solution?<br>
The fun is in knowing why we didn't.<br>

The problem apparently was stated such that, it influences you brain to think a particular way.<br>
