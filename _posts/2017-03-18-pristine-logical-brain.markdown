> In my previous [post](/blog/2017/03/17/leftbrain-rightbrain/), we looked at a famous myth of the [LeftBrain-RightBrain dominance](/blog/2017/03/17/leftbrain-rightbrain/).<br>
Though we now know, that the brain is made up of two closely collaborating divisions, rather than two competing divisions of dominance, the fact that the brain approaches a scenario or problem statement via distinctive paradigms, can never be denied.<br>
The brain works in mysterious ways.<br>
In fact, over the years, scientists have been viewing the brain as a [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) (though it more looks like a walnut), and trying to crack its behavior.<br>
Though we have been making progress, there still isn't any complete clarity on its work-ways.<br>
Let's explore our human brain a little more in this post and find out [WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in it's working.

## Play it like a sport
<hr>

The first life on earth is said to have appeared 3 billion years ago.<br>
Life has evolved and adapted over these years and as humans, we are the acme of evolution.<br>

The purpose of life over all those years, has however remained constant - **survive and procreate**. As simple as that.<br>
Simple as it may seem, survival is a very tricky problem statement.<br>
You need to adapt to the surroundings. You need to learn the tricks of the trade.<br>
It's like playing a sport, like for eg. [Tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis).<br>
You need to learn all the shots of tennis and adapt to all the surfaces (grass, clay and hard) if you have to survive in the international arena for long.<br>
The choice of shot varies drastically based on the surface and also the weather. When its windy for eg., you need to control the shots differently.<br>

On the same lines, every species had to be situationally aware in order to survive.<br>
Thus nature developed senses, to understand the ambience better.<br>
The sense of sight, sound and smell were pivotal in understanding and responding to the surroundings.<br>
The sense of touch and feelings, pain for eg, were feedback. The feedback helped the species to fairly gauge a situation and devise new strategies or reject existing ones.

## The Optimisation
<hr>

Similar to [tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis) however, this learning is a perpetual process. Because we need to survive against similar species who are learning as well.<br>
**Our predators are learning, our preys are learning.**<br>
So, every bit of optimisation is crucial for survival.<br>
Its not enough if we somehow manage to do it, we need to do it well and do it fast.<br>
Its not enough to learn all the tricks of the trade, we need to devise new ones and keep moving forward.

And life isn't a sport.<br>
**It's not fair and no one is going to play a fair game either.**<br>
There are no rules and the constraints can drastically change over night, so the species must be quick to adapt.<br>

This is where optimisation matters. How do you quickly react?<br>

### <u>Pattern Recognition</u>
The brain basically identifies patterns and pre-determines responses to these patterns, to improve the reaction time.<br>
These patterns and responses are revisited time and again and enhanced and updated over time.

For starters, the brain can be viewed like a huge [hashmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table).<br>
So, if the brain has been in a situation before, it can quickly respond to a similar situation at a later point of time. This is critical in reacting to your predator's moves.<br>

Let's take an example.<br>
How many of us remember dozing off in a public transport and suddenly waking up out of nowhere, and still in an instant, managing to precisely realise where exactly we are.<br>
Better still, how many us remember dozing off in a public transport and effortlessly waking up exactly at our destination, just before we alight.<br>

_**All this is possible because of the brain's situational awareness which is nothing but a sophisticated pattern recognition**_.
This is more evident in repetitive tasks and the adage **Practice makes Perfect** is synonymous to [muscle memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory).

### <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory">Muscle Memory</a></u>
>Muscle memory is a form of procedural memory that involves consolidating a specific task into memory through repetition. When a movement is repeated over time, a long-term muscle memory is created for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed **without conscious effort**. This process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency. Examples are everyday activities, such as riding a bicycle, playing a musical instrument, etc.

Have you ever wondered how sportsmen in any sport are able to react to events in milliseconds? Turing the car @ 300Km/hr in [F1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory) or returning a ball @ 160mph in [Tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis).<br>
No conscious effort, just muscle memory.<br>
So the goal is to build a comprehensive muscle memory.<br>
But how does one build this muscle memory?

## Building the patterns
<hr>

The right brain is predominantly involved in identifying these patterns.<br>
It thus greatly relies on the senses, the sense of touch, sound, sight, etc for the same.

Have you ever heard of muscle memory?
