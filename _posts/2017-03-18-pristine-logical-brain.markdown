> In my previous [post](/blog/2017/03/17/leftbrain-rightbrain/), we looked at a famous myth of the [LeftBrain-RightBrain dominance](/blog/2017/03/17/leftbrain-rightbrain/).<br>
Though we now know, that the brain is made up of two closely collaborating divisions, rather than two competing divisions of dominance, the fact that the brain approaches a scenario or problem statement via distinctive paradigms, can never be denied.<br>
The brain works in mysterious ways.<br>
In fact, over the years, scientists have been viewing the brain as a [T-Nut](/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) (though it more looks like a walnut), and trying to crack its behavior.<br>
Though we have been making progress, there still isn't any complete clarity on its work-ways.<br>
Let's explore our human brain a little more in this post and find out [WTF](/blog/2017/02/13/welcome-aboard/) in it's working.

## Play it like a sport<hr>

The first life on earth is said to have appeared 3 billion years ago.<br>
Life has evolved and adapted over these years and as humans, we are the acme of evolution.<br>

The purpose of life over all those years, has however remained constant - **survive and procreate**. As simple as that.<br>
Simple as it may seem, survival is a very tricky problem statement.<br>
You need to adapt to the surroundings. You need to learn the tricks of the trade.<br>
It's like playing a sport, like for eg. [Tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis).<br>
You need to learn all the shots of tennis and adapt to all the surfaces (grass, clay and hard) if you have to survive in the international arena for long.<br>
The choice of shot varies drastically based on the surface and also the weather. When its windy, you need to control the shots differently.<br>

The problem statement for species to survive is quite similar and they had be situation aware.<br>
Thus, nature developed senses to understand the ambience.<br>
The sense of sight, sound and smell were pivotal in understanding and responding to the surroundings.<br>
The sense of touch and feelings, pain for eg, were feedback. The feedback helped the species to understand a situation, surrounding, etc and devise new strategies or reject existing ones.

## The Optimisation

Similar to [tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis) however, this learning is a perpetual process. Because we need to survive against similar species who are learning as well.<br>
**Our predators are learning, our preys are learning.**<br>
So, every bit of optimisation is critical for survival.<br>
Its not enough if we somehow manage to do it, we need to do it well and do it fast.

And life isn't a sport.<br>
**It's not fair and no one is going to play a fair game either.**
There are no rules and the constraints can drastically change over night, so the species must be quick to adapt.<br>

This is where optimisation matters. How do you quickly react?<br>
The brain basically identifies patterns and pre-determines responses to these patterns, to improce the reaction time<br>
These patterns and responses are revisited time and again and enhanced and updated over time.




The right brain is predominantly involved in identifying these patterns.<br>
It thus greatly relies on the senses, the sense of touch, sound, sight, etc for the same.

Have you ever heard of muscle memory?
